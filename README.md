<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>


Make an app allowing users to track the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.

The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored or multiple important metrics to track. Code wise, requirements include two columns - one for each team, multiple buttons, updating views, properly scoping variables, finding views by their ID. A reset button should be included as well.
